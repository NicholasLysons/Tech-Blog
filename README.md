# Tech-Blog


This application allows any sort of developer to use the power of databases to create blog posts. These blog posts allow them to view the posts about any tech post or question they may have.

When the user enters the homepage of this application, they are greeted with a login screen that allows them to sign in with an email and password to store their data in a database so they can come back to their posts later. Once they enter their email and password, they will be able to create a post that others can see and will be stored when the page is refreshed.
